Install required software
-------------------------

For Debian based systems, this portion has been automated. A script is included with the
Yombo Gateway to get your Debian based system running quickly. After downloading the
gateway (next step), simply go into the `installer` directory and execute
`sudo bash ./debian-setup.sh`.

It is recommened to create a local user account, download the gateway to /opt/yombo-gateway,
and execute the above mentioned script while logged in as that user.

Your system is ready, continue to: :doc:`installing the gateway <../chapters/install-gateway>`.

Don't forget to execute the ./installer/debian-setup.sh file after downloading.
