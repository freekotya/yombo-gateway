Update Gateway
##################

The gateway will automatically download updated modules, but the core
software must be updated manually.  To complete an update, change
to the gateway directory and run:

git pull

This will download and "patch" the gateway to latest version. When the gateway runs,
it will automatically process any required changes to the database as needed.
