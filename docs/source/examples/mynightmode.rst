At `Yombo Projects <https://projects.yombo.net>`_ there is a more complex module example under the heading of
"`Building Your First Module <https://projects.yombo.net/projects/modules/wiki/Building_you_first_module>`_".

Otherwise, review one of these more simple modules:

* :ref:`LogReader <logreader>` - Demonstrates using the Yombo filereader to
  monitor a file for reading. It also demonstrates sending device command
  :ref:`messages <message>` when valid voice command is found in a file.
* :ref:`LogWriter <logwriter>` - Demonstrates subscribing to all messages in a gateway. This
  module logs everything it receives to a file.

As a quick start, you copy/paste the :ref:`Empty Module <emptymodule>`
