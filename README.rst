Yombo Gateway Overview
======================

The Yombo Gateway Framework provides a base foundation that allows users to
quickly and easily automate various devices (Z-Wave, X10, Insteon, etc).
This framework can also act a bridge between vendor protocols. For example,
an X10 controler can be mapped to control Z-Wave or Insteon products.

The gateway can also be easily extended using modules. The modules can:
* Extend the features of the framework throug the use of hooks.
* Provide additional API features to other modules.
* Provide advanced automation rules and tasks.
